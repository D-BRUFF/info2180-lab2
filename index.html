					<h4>Grace Hopper</h4>
					<div class="wrap_image1"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg" alt="Grace Hopper"></div>
					<p>Undeniably famous in the tech world, Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper was an esteemed computer scientist and one of the first computer programmers to work on the Harvard Mark I. Her work led to the development of COBOL, an early programming language we is still used to this day. In 1947, she recorded the worlds first ever real computer bug, and it is also said that she coined the phrase: “it is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.” </p>

					<h4>Ada Lovelace</h4>
					<div class="wrap_image2"><img src="https://www.stylist.co.uk/images/app/uploads/2018/10/09155947/ada-lovelace-day-2018-quotes-facts-biography-crop-1539097203-1366x1366.jpg?w=1200&h=1&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress" alt="Ada Lovelace"></div>
					<p>Ada was the daughter of romantic poet, Lord Byron, and his wife, Anna Isabella-Byron. Her mathematical talent shone through in her early life, and her skills and interest in machines lead to a working relationship with Charles Babbage. Babbage was the inventor of the “Analytical Engine”, a complicated device that was never actually created, but resembled the elements of a modern computer. As a result of her work on the project, Ada is often referred to as the “world’s first computer programmer”. It was Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine that Alan Turing used as a form of inspiration for his work on the first modern computer in the 1940s.</p></article>

					<h4>Annie Easley: The NASA Rocket Scientist</h4>
					<div class="wrap_image1"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/stem-fatale-podcast/episode-032-annie-easley-KL1JdNRUFqt-cPqSY_4WRk6.549x549.jpg" alt="Annie Easley"></div>
					<p>Annie was a NASA rocket scientist, and a trailblazer for gender and racial diversity in STEM. When hired, she was one of only four black employees at the Lab. 34 years later, she had contributed to numerous programs as a computer scientist, inspired many through her enthusiastic participation in outreach programs, and broken down barriers as equal employment opportunity counsellor. Easley's vital work on the Centaur rocket project while at NASA laid the foundations for space shuttle launches in the future.</p>

					<h4>Adele Goldberg: The Inspiration For GUI</h4>
					<div class="wrap_image2"><img src="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/userdata/images/large/66/69/product-96669.jpg" alt="Adele Goldberg"></div>
					<p>Adele was instrumental in the development of the programming language Smalltalk-80, which inspired the very first Apple computer. Adele is said to have referred to the decision to show Steve Jobs Smalltalk as a way to “give away the kitchen sink”. She was probably right! The concepts that Adele and her team set in motion became the basis for graphical user interfaces (GUI) we use every day</p></article>
